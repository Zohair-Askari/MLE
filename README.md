# 🔥 MLE: Who Wrote It? (Zohair vs. Ateeb Edition) 🚀

## 📜 **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for Authorship Analysis**
Welcome to the **coolest AI x NLP** project where we **detect who wrote an unknown document** using **probability magic!** Inspired by the Hamilton vs. Madison controversy, we flipped the script with our own showdown: **Zohair vs. Ateeb!** 🤯

---

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
Ever wondered how AI figures out who wrote what? **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** helps us estimate the probability that a document was written by a specific person. We used this concept to analyze **three documents:**

- ✍️ **Document 1** – Written by Zohair 📝
- ✍️ **Document 2** – Written by Ateeb 📝
- ❓ **Unknown Document** – Who wrote this?! 🤔

By crunching word probabilities and comparing patterns, we **proved** that the unknown document was **written by Zohair!** 🔥

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
- 🐍 **Python** – The boss language 💪
- 📊 **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** – Making sense of words
- 🔢 **MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation)** – Math wizardry 🧙‍♂️
- 🔍 **Probability & Statistics** – Numbers don’t lie 🔢
- 📂 **Text Processing** – Cleaning up the mess 🧹

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. **Read the Documents** – Load Zohair’s, Ateeb’s, and the unknown document.
2. **Word Probabilities** – Count how often each word appears in each document.
3. **MLE Magic** – Calculate the probability of the unknown document belonging to each author.
4. **Compare & Predict** – The higher probability wins!
5. 🎉 **Boom! We found the author!**
